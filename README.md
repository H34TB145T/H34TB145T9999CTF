# A Cryptography CTF Developed by H34TB145T
Difficulty: Medium - Hard (Depends on your experience) 

## Description
This CTF was developed to test the Cryptography skills. In this box, I've put less than 10 Cryptographic algorithms all mixed together. I grantee you will find this interesting, as I have put some efforts to entertain the Players. I've hidden some flags in it. I've uploaded this challenge on my Facebook account initially as a step 1. From this GitHub you can assume you are continuing from the step 2.
